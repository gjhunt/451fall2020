#Website

Information for the course can be found on blackboard or on github at gjhunt.github.io/451fall2020

#Lectures

The lectures are remote and asynchronous. Each Monday I will post two lectures for that week which will each be 80 minutes long. They will be posted to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8bivwGDerXoGLimP2BkNzXXDQNymX44y) along with individual links posted on the github page. I will also post a .pdf of the lecture notes from that week along with the videos. 

Additionally, I will be posting links to [Dr. Leemis's 451 Lecture Videos](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/videos/ttc/). They are more in-depth than my lecture and extremely high-quality. 

#Office Hours

Office hours will be held on zoom, times will be Tuesdays 3:30-5 pm EST and Wedsnesdays 9-10:30 am EST. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email.

#Weekly Quiz Problems (QPs)

Each week I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following Thursday at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 20% of your final grade. The lowest two QP grades will be dropped. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers. 

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 on Thursday a zero will be entered for the grade. By droppping the lowest two grades, missing one or two won't hurt your grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP. 

#Suggested Problems (SPs)

Additionally I will post a selection of suggested problems along with solutions. You are highly encouraged to do these problems as just doing just the one quiz problem will not be enough to prepare you for the midterm and final. I will also post suggested reading along with the suggested problems. 

#Midterm

There will be a remote midterm exam Thursday Oct 8th between 7 and 8:30 PM EST. More information will be given closer to that date. 

#Final

There will be a similar remote final exam. The date and time is TBA.
